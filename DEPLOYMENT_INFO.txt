- Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" providers.
- Create a "Service Account" to get the JSON key for the Backend.
- Copy Client Config (apiKey, authDomain, etc.) for the Frontend.
- Used in Backend: FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
- Used in Frontend: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY, etc.

--- 3. BACKEND API (FastAPI) ---
Recommended Platform: Render (https://render.com) or Railway (https://railway.app)
- Repository: Connect your GitHub repo.
- Root Directory: backend
- Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start Command: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
- Env Vars: See backend/.env.example
- NOTE: Uploaded documents are stored in the 'uploads/' folder. On services like 
  Render/Railway, this storage is EPHEMERAL. For permanent storage, you should 
  mount a Persistent Volume or integrate AWS S3 / Supabase Storage.

--- 4. FRONTEND (Next.js) ---
Recommended Platform: Vercel (https://vercel.com)
- Repository: Connect your GitHub repo.
- Root Directory: frontend

--- 6. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST & ORDER ---
1. Deploy Database (Supabase).
2. Run Migrations: alembic upgrade head (Run this from a local machine pointing 
   to the remote DB, or via a CI/CD pipeline).
3. Deploy Backend (Render/Railway).
4. Copy the Backend URL (e.g., https://api.yourdomain.com).
5. Deploy Frontend (Vercel) with the Backend URL as NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL.
